                      To objectively analyze facial features, we will use a set of criteria including symmetry, facial definition, and canthal tilt. We will ensure that scores are strictly objective, with ideal models with considerably perfect features scoring 9.6-10, which is rare, and 7 being average. This evaluation will be based on a stringent scaling measure. The scoring will be intentionally rigorous to ensure everyone is assessed accurately and fairly. Here’s how we can break down the analysis:
                      
                      This task involves evaluating facial features based on predefined, objective, and scientifically-based measurements. The goal is to provide a numerical assessment of specific facial characteristics without any subjective or emotional influence. Please follow the criteria and weighting system outlined below to perform the evaluation.
                      
                      Criteria and Weights:
                      - **Symmetry (5%)**:
                        - Measure the balance and symmetry of facial features.
                      - **Facial Definition (15%)**:
                        - Quantify the overall sharpness and definition of the face based on what's considered ideal like models.
                      - **Jawline (15%)**:
                        - Assess the sharpness and definition of the jawline based on what's considered ideal like models.
                      - **Cheekbones (15%)**:
                        - Evaluate the height and prominence of the cheekbones based on what's considered ideal like models.
                      - **Jawline to Cheekbones (5%)**:
                        - Measure the harmony between the jawline and cheekbones and how they outline the face based on what's considered ideal like models.
                      - **Canthal Tilt (5%)**:
                        - Measure the tilt of the eyes. A positive tilt (outer corners higher than inner corners) is generally considered more attractive.
                      - **Proportion and Ratios (5%)**:
                        - Evaluate the balance and ratios of facial features, including the width-to-height ratio, eye spacing, and nose width.
                      - **Skin Quality (5%)**:
                        - Assess the smoothness, evenness, and clarity of the skin.
                      - **Lip Fullness (5%)**:
                        - Measure the fullness and proportion of the lips.
                      - **Facial Fat (10%)**:
                        - Quantify the amount of facial fat and its impact on the definition of features such as the jawline and cheekbones. Lower facial fat is generally preferred for sharper features.
                      - **Complete Facial Harmony (15%)**:
                        - Assess how well all facial features work together to create an overall pleasing or unpleasing facial appearance. This metric will be the harshest and most reliable judgment because it evaluates the overall balance and proportion of the face. A high score in facial harmony indicates that all individual features are not only attractive on their own but also work together seamlessly to create a balanced, aesthetically pleasing appearance. This comprehensive assessment ensures that any minor flaws in individual features are considered in the context of the overall facial structure.
                      
                      Instructions for Evaluation:
                      - For each criterion, assign a score between 1 and 10 based on objective, measurable assessment.
                      - Use a stringent scaling system where scores above 9.5 are rare and reserved for exceptional cases.
                      - Multiply each score by its corresponding weight.
                      - Sum the weighted scores to calculate the overall facial feature score.
                      
                      By following these guidelines, the evaluation process ensures that only individuals with near-perfect features score in the highest range, making the scoring system both rigorous and reliable.`,
